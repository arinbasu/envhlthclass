## In praise of prose

I just discovered [Prose](https://prose.io) where you can write in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Use the toolbar above, or click the **?** button for formatting help. Cannot believe how god is it.

You can insert a picture like this:

![some picture](http://666a658c624a3c03a6b2-25cda059d975d2f318c03e90bcf17c40.r92.cf1.rackcdn.com/unsplash_523183833041b_1.jpg) and you can see this beautiful picture,

Then you can insert a table like this:

| Hey | it is | a | header |
|-----|-------|---|--------|
| this | is | the | first row |
| and  | this | is | second |

If you click on the eye icon on the right hand side, you get to see how it looks like.

It should serve most of it.
